Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
I started with base code however, I implemented a deep learning Q-algorithm which would allow the pirate to havigate to the treasure. This algorithm allowed the agent to explore 
the environment until the agent was able to reach a 100% accuracy in finding the path.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientist can develop new technologies, applications, systems. In this class we explored how computer scientist learn new technologies. One emerging technology is AI, researching
and further exploring and devloping this technology is important since it can help society with certain problems faced daily. Ai may facilitate certain tasks, and the use technolgy in this
aspect allows improvements in day to day life. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I frist approach a problem by having a clear understanding of what the client expects, I first determine the requirements and needs of each project or problem and make detailed list. 
Any topic which I do not feel confident in, in regards to my knowledge, I make sure to research. Upon researching I start creating a project which meets the expectations, I use a iterative
process, making sure I'm visually inspecting code and also testing code as I go. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Ethical responsibilities include securing the user's sensitive data and personal information, ensuring that the technologies do not pose a significant danger to users. In this case
specifically, ensuring that bias is reduced in AI is also very important.
